    <h3>Project 1: Old Language - New Image</h3>
    <p>I think about my "journey of self-discovery" every day, and to be able to express what I've been going through
      using art feels cathartic. It took a while, but I was able to find passages that described different stages of
      this "journey." The images themselves came naturally to me.</p>

    <h3>Project 2: Quietest Place</h3>
    <p>Even though my location was on campus, I had never been there specifically, and it was great. I got a chance
      to take a break from everything. With more resources, I wouldâ€™ve gotten some better equipment to block out the
      wind, but I am very satisfied with the final result.</p>
