    <h3>Project 1: Old Language - New Image</h3>
    <p>This project, titled <em>Past, Present, and Future</em>, depicts three images that describe a personal journey of
      self-discovery. When I wanted the viewer to still be able to read the surrounding text, I used lighter colors,
      such as pink and blue. However, I used more black when that was less important. Having not many materials at my
      disposal, I made due with pens of various colors, and cut and rearranged the page. The rearranging of pages was
      inspired by a classmate, Victoria Messinger. The last image was partially inspired by M.C. Escher and his use
      of negative space.</p>

    <h3>Project 2: Quietest Place</h3>
    <p>My project, titled <em>Respite</em>, is a short video of the location I chose as my “quietest place.” The goal of this
      project was to sit in a relaxing environment and create music inspired by the surroundings. My aim was to create
      a work that embodied a time of rest in between the hustle and bustle of life. I used a portable USB piano,
      Ableton Live, and Adobe Premier. Once I found a spot, I got an idea for the music I wanted to make, then filmed
      and performed the work. Afterward, I edited it all together. The music was inspired by Levi Niha and FKJ.</p>
